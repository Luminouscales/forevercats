Carefully you reach inside and hoist the joint in between two talons, tapping the ash off lightly.
It's barely touched, despite that its creator clearly put some love into it.
The ground up weed sits snugly inside the carefully rolled paper. The filter has an almost mathematical zigzag to it, fitting perfectly inside.
You swiftly light its charred end, and pull. The air flow is magnificent, smoke hitting your throat with little effort.
It tastes as wonderful as every time, holding your lungs tight in a jagged, burning embrace.
Your chest flattens in rest and the smoke wistfully relents to the yellow of the room.

[SERENDIPITY] You used to be joined like this with the love of this world, sharing embers with distant lips, warm in the streetlights of the night. Now, so far away, alone, even the stars are locked in the white brick ceiling.

Numb pleasure coiling through your scales, dragging you down like a sleepy lover to bed.

[DEBUGGING] It'll be easier for you to fall asleep now.
[/SERENDIPITY] Feels like there's something out there, thoughts wandering the streetlights. Maybe go and check.
