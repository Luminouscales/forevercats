[SERENDIPITY] No one ascertains that there is yet hope, there is someone to fight for, perhaps someone to take you in.
[SERENDIPITY] Air and snow, steel trees and concrete. A vehicle passes by. They don't bother to stop at the red light.
[SERENDIPITY] They have somewhere to be, perhaps a cosy room?...
[SERENDIPITY] An apartment, a modest speck upon the universe's destiny, your everything, and everything that belongs to you, your locus, where you wake and dream, fall tears and find pleasure.
[SERENDIPITY] From the window you see a dying soul.
