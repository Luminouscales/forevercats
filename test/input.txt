Reluctantly, you place your right claw on the table and bend down.
Your back is sore, the pain strains your scales, pushing some air out of your lungs and making your wings squirm.
[ENCYCLOPEDIA] I still advise you to stretch more often, and sleep longer. Soothes your body and mind. The psychedelics you take do not help at night.
The lamp spills into a mellow shadow on the carpet. It's oddly peaceful here, clean too, the wooden roof protecting the floor from damage.
[ELECTROCHEMISTRY] A familiar sight, right? You remember all the things you've done under a party table. Mostly blacking out. It really is cozy, the way a cave is cozy for a wet animal.
Nothing to see here, besides an empty baggie of the small variety. The carpet will be bothersome to vacuum, though.
[ELECTROCHEMISTRY] Hey, now. How do you know it's really empty? Don't throw around baseless facts. It's dark down here, go check!
	# ...why would I do that?
	# [ELECTROCHEMISTRY] Come on now. Your heart is running a little faster at the very thought. Your body's talking to you.
	# [DEBUGGING] I'll warn you, if there's actually something in it, it's very likely you won't be able to resist the urge. It's happened before.
	# Examine the baggie.
		# You get on your knees to slither further into the darkness. With one stretch of your thin arm the plastic rustles promisingly in your pink claw.
		# It's...
		# [ELECTROCHEMISTRY] ...not empty. There's still some left. When do I ever let you down?
			# Often.
			[ELECTROCHEMISTRY] Shut up.
		# [ENCYCLOPEDIA] When 'eyeballing' it, it appears to be around 200 miligrams of the unidentified powder.
		# Get to snorting the thing already!
		# Snort only a little bit.
		# Examine the powder more closely.
			# It's stereotypically white, and ground into fineness, forming tiny clumps, like snow on three branches.
		 	# Your pink muzzle tells you it has a powerful smell, though you can't quite put your finger on it.
			# [DEBUGGING] Don't stimulants usually smell? I think they do.
			# [ENCYCLOPEDIA] It is common knowledge that it is extremely unreliable to discern a substance by its appearance. Also known is that you should not ingest unknown substances.
			# [ELECTROCHEMISTRY] Are you talking to Encyclopedia? Don't. Nerds don't know fun.
		# Actually, let's keep it for later.
			# [ELECTROCHEMISTRY] Really? You seem to be feeling veeery strongly about the powder inside. Who knows what it could be? How it could make you feel...
			# Discard the thought.
			# No, seriously. I'm putting it down.
				# It's almost like you can feel the powder burning in your nostrils, the yellow straw in your claw...
				# The tiny rush in your heart growing into a flame, warming up every little nerve ending as it spreads through your body...
				# Past your flat, rhythmic chest, the air warm and pleasing in your lungs, like a fireplace in winter...
				# Caressing your cheek, licking a sharp smile out of the frozen ennui on your face...
				# Finally hitting your brain like an orgasm, drowning all your thoughts in a woozy, giddy haze...
				# [DEBUGGING] The night is late. You won't feel anything besides letting the comedown come back. Think of the hangover tomorrow morning.
				# Snort the whole thing already.

	# Leave the baggie where it is.
		# [ELECTROCHEMISTRY] Whatever, sure. It'll be stuck in your head now. Good luck falling asleep later.
			[DEBUGGING] Good work. This feeling will pass. It's better in the long run.
