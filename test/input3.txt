The corridor pierces through her apartment like a tight vein, cold tiles connecting the kitchen and Mef's room with the light dimly spilling from the living room.
There's an ashy cat curled up on the doorhandle. You can't go in.
[ARS FELINE] It would be rude to disturb it. Try tomorrow.


You need not open the fridge to know the penury that is inside. Half-empty condiments sit scattered furtively, and not much else. Coffee milk.
You can taste the clear liquid in the vodka bottle in your nose. It makes you wince.
People in her circumstances don't eat a lot. Not inside, alone, at least.
[DEBUGGING] This means no breakfast tomorrow. Just tea and cigarettes.


Quietude. Fleeting squares of light on your tiny skyscrapers. Hundreds of rooms in parallel, reluctant of one another.
Street lights turn green, yellow, red, but no one passes by.
You're too sober for stargazing.
[SERENDIPITY] No one ascertains that there is yet hope, there is someone to fight for, perhaps someone to take you in.
[SERENDIPITY] Air and snow, steel trees and concrete. A vehicle passes by. They don't bother to stop at the red light.
[SERENDIPITY] They have somewhere to be, perhaps a cosy room?...
[SERENDIPITY] An apartment, a modest speck upon the universe's destiny, your everything, and everything that belongs to you, your locus, where you wake and dream, fall tears and find pleasure.
[SERENDIPITY] From the window you see a dying soul.



Numb pleasure coiling through your scales, dragging you down like a sleepy lover to bed.
Feels like there's something out there, thoughts wandering the streetlights. Maybe go and check.
